/*
 * Suppose say you are working for a company that is building a new office
 * complex. The company needs to install network cables to connect all the
 * office buildings in the most cost-effective way. The buildings are located in
 * a grid, and there are possible routes between pairs of buildings. Each route
 * has an associated cost based on the distance between buildings. Your task is
 * to help the company minimize the total cost of wiring the buildings together
 * using Primâ€™s Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph.
